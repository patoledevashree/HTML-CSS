				<p>Mumbai, formerly called Bombay, is often and rightly called the financial hub of the seventh largest
					nation in the world. With its fast pace of life and where time spent with another ought to be of
					value, often the Heritage and History that this city has to offer is conveniently sidelined. But as
					this city is popularly called the Gateway to India with many making it their entry, exit or even
					their transit points, one is starting to realize that the city has far more to offer than just what
					is marketed in many-a-brochure.</p>

				<p>Chhatrapati Shivaji, formerly known as Victoria Terminus, is a truly historic railway station,
					located in the South Mumbai area. The significance of this historical building is evident from the
					fact that in July 2004, UNESCO declared it as a World Heritage Site. No wonder, it is one of the
					most clicked monuments in India. In fact, the second most photographed Indian monument, with Taj
					Mahal being the first (as per numerous accounts).</p>

				<img src="gateway.jpg" alt="gateway">
				<p>Built to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to India in 1911, the Gateway of India
					is one of the most iconic monuments of Mumbai. Surprisingly though, the foundation of the building
					was laid in 1911, it was three years later, in 1914, that the design of the monument was finally
					sanctioned. It then took another ten years to build this historical monument.</p>

				<p>Mani Bhavan was home to the Mahatma during his 17-year stay in Mumbai, from 1917 to 1934. It was this
					place, from where Mahatma Gandhi conceptualised and launched some of the most disruptive freedom
					movements against the British Raj in India, including Satyagraha, Swadeshi Movement and Civil
					Disobedience Movement. </p>
